                    Narendra Damodardas Modi born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician serving as the 14th and
                    current Prime Minister of India since 2014 . Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to
                    2014 and is the Member of Parliament from Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party
                    (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary
                    volunteer organisation. He is the longest serving prime minister from outside the Indian National
                    Congress.Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his
                    secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at age eight. He has reminisced about helping out
                    after school at his father's tea stall at the Vadnagar railway station. At age 18, Modi was married
                    to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, whom he abandoned soon after. He first publicly acknowledged her as
                    his wife more than four decades later when required to do so by Indian law, but has made no contact
                    with her since. Modi has asserted he had travelled in northern India for two years after leaving his
                    parental home, visiting a number of religious centres, but few details of his travels have emerged.
                    Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the state of
                    emergency was declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975, Modi went into hiding. The RSS
                    assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001,
                    rising to the rank of general secretary.Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to
                    Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was
                    elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in
                    the 2002 Gujarat riots in which 1044 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim,[d] or
                    otherwise criticised for its management of the crisis. A Special Investigation Team appointed by the
                    Supreme Court of India found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi
                    personally.[e] While his policies as chief minister—credited with encouraging economic growth—have
                    received praise, his administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health,
                    poverty and education indices in the state.[f]

                    Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party a majority in the lower house of
                    Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since 1984. Modi's
                    administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced
                    spending on healthcare, education, and social welfare programmes. Modi centralised power by
                    abolishing the Planning Commission and replacing it with the NITI Aayog. He began a high-profile
                    sanitation campaign, controversially initiated a demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and a
                    transformation of the taxation regime, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. He
                    oversaw the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Prime Minister, Modi has received
                    consistently high approval ratings.

                    Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding.Following his party's victory in
                    the 2019 general election, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir,
                    introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act and three controversial farm laws, which prompted
                    widespread protests and sit-ins across the country, resulting in a formal repeal of the latter.
                    Described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure
                    of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his handling
                    of the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.

                        <p>Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of
                            grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the
                            third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915–1989) and Hiraben Modi
                            (1923–2022). Modi's family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser)
                            community,which is categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian government.
                            <br>
                            Modi had only infrequently spoken of his family background during his 13 years as chief
                            minister of Gujarat. In the run up to the 2014 national elections, he began to regularly
                            draw attention to his low-ranking social origins and to having to work as a child in his
                            father's tea shop on the Vadnagar railway station platform, a description that the evidence
                            of neighbours does not entirely corroborate.[35][36] Modi completed his higher secondary
                            education in Vadnagar in 1967, where teachers described him as an average student and a keen
                            gifted debater, with interest in theatre.Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters
                            in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.
                            <br>

                            When eight years old, Modi was introduced to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began
                            attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar,
                            popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) in the
                            RSS and became his political mentor.[40] While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met
                            Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who were founding
                            members of the BJP's Gujarat unit in 1980.
                            <br>

                            In a custom traditional to Narendra Modi's caste, his family arranged a betrothal to a girl,
                            Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when she was 17 and he was 18. Soon
                            afterwards, he abandoned his bride,and left home, never divorcing her, but the marriage
                            remaining unmentioned in Modi's public pronouncements for many decades.In April 2014,
                            shortly before the national elections that swept him to power, Modi publicly affirmed that
                            he was married and his spouse was Jashodaben; the couple has remained married, but
                            estranged. Reportedly, their marriage was never consummated, and he kept it a secret because
                            otherwise he could not have become a pracharak in the puritan Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.
                            <br>
                            Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India, though
                            few details of where he went have emerged.In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu
                            ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita
                            Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. Modi remained only a short time at
                            each, since he lacked the required college education. Vivekananda has been described as a
                            large influence in Modi's life.
                            <br>
                            In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math but was turned away, after which
                            Modi wandered through Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati.
                            Modi then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before
                            travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968–69. Sometime in late 1969 or
                            early 1970, Modi returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for
                            Ahmedabad.There, Modi lived with his uncle, working in the latter's canteen at the Gujarat
                            State Road Transport Corporation.
                            <br>
                            In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar
                            Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city. Modi's first known political activity as an adult was
                            in 1971 when he, as per his remarks, joined a Jana Sangh Satyagraha in Delhi led by Atal
                            Bihari Vajpayee to enlist for the battlefield during the Bangladesh Liberation War The
                            Indira Gandhi-led central government disallowed open support for the Mukti Bahini, and Modi
                            says he was put in Tihar Jail for a short period. After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he
                            stopped working for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS
                            working under Inamdar. Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest
                            against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested (as per his claim);
                            this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to mentor him. Many years later Modi
                            would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001. Modi's claim that he was part of
                            a Satyagraha led to a political war. Applications were filed with the PMO under the RTI Act
                            seeking details of his arrest. In reply, the PMO claimed that it maintains official records
                            on Modi only since he took charge as the Prime Minister of India in 2014. Despite this
                            claim, the official website of the PMO contains specific information about Modi which dates
                            back to the 1950s.
                            <br>
                            In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the School of Open
                            Learning (SOL) at the University of Delhi, graduating with a third class.[69] Five years
                            later, in 1983, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat
                            University, graduating with a first class as an external distance learning student. There is
                            a controversy surrounding his educational qualification. Replying to an RTI query, the SOL
                            said it did not have any data of students who received a BA degree in 1978

                        <p>In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India which
                            lasted until 1977. During this period, known as "The Emergency", many of her political
                            opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned. Modi was appointed general
                            secretary of the "Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti", an RSS committee co-ordinating opposition
                            to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned. Modi was forced to go
                            underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest. He became
                            involved in printing pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising
                            demonstrations. Modi was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for
                            individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and
                            activists. During this period, Modi wrote a book in Gujarati, Sangharsh Ma Gujarat (In The
                            Struggles of Gujarat), describing events during the Emergency. Among the people he met in
                            this role was trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes, as well as several
                            other national political figures. In his travels during the Emergency, Modi was often forced
                            to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a Sikh.<br>Modi became an RSS
                            sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS activities in the areas of
                            Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he was put to
                            work researching and writing the RSS's version of the history of the Emergency. He returned
                            to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985. In 1987 Modi
                            helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won
                            comfortably; Modi's planning has been described as the reason for that result by
                            biographers. After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to
                            place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad
                            election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of
                            the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.<br>Modi rose within the party and was named a member
                            of the BJP's National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise L. K. Advani's 1990 Ram
                            Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi's 1991–92 Ekta Yatra (Journey for Unity) .
                            However, he took a brief break from politics in 1992, instead establishing a school in
                            Ahmedabad; friction with Shankersinh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat at the time, also played
                            a part in this decision.[91] Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the
                            insistence of Advani, and as party secretary, Modi's electoral strategy was considered
                            central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly elections.[92][93] In November of that
                            year Modi was appointed BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he
                            assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.[94] The
                            following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the
                            Indian National Congress (Congress, INC) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok
                            Sabha elections. Modi, on the selection committee for the 1998 Assembly elections in
                            Gujarat, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to
                            end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as key to the BJP winning an
                            overall majority in the 1998 elections, and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary
                            (organisation) in May of that year.</p>

                        <p>In 1995 Modi was made the secretary of the BJP’s national organization in New Delhi, and
                            three years later he was appointed its general secretary. He remained in that office for
                            another three years, but in October 2001 he replaced the incumbent Gujarat chief minister,
                            fellow BJP member Keshubhai Patel, after Patel had been held responsible for the state
                            government’s poor response in the aftermath of the massive Bhuj earthquake in Gujarat
                            earlier that year that killed more than 20,000 people. Modi entered his first-ever electoral
                            contest in a February 2002 by-election that won him a seat in the Gujarat state assembly.
                            <br>Modi’s political career thereafter remained a mixture of deep controversy and
                            self-promoted achievements. His role as chief minister during communal riots that engulfed
                            Gujarat in 2002 was particularly questioned. He was accused of condoning the violence or, at
                            least, of doing little to stop the killing of more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, that
                            ensued after dozens of Hindu passengers died when their train was set on fire in the city of
                            Godhra. In 2005 the United States declined to issue him a diplomatic visa on the grounds
                            that he was responsible for the 2002 riots, and the United Kingdom also criticized his role
                            in 2002. Although in the succeeding years Modi himself escaped any indictment or
                            censure—either by the judiciary or by investigative agencies—some of his close associates
                            were found guilty of complicity in the 2002 events and received lengthy jail sentences.
                            Modi’s administration was also accused of involvement in extrajudicial killings (variously
                            termed “encounters” or “fake encounters”) by police or other authorities. One such case, in
                            2004, involved the deaths of a woman and three men whom officials said were members of
                            Lashkar-e-Taiba (a Pakistan-based terrorist organization that was involved in the 2008
                            Mumbai terrorist attacks) and were alleged to have been plotting to assassinate Modi.
                            <br>Modi’s repeated political success in Gujarat, however, made him an indispensable leader
                            within the BJP hierarchy and led to his reintegration into the political mainstream. Under
                            his leadership, the BJP secured a significant victory in the December 2002 legislative
                            assembly elections, winning 127 of the 182 seats in the chamber (including a seat for Modi).
                            Projecting a manifesto for growth and development in Gujarat, the BJP was again victorious
                            in the 2007 state assembly elections, with a seat total of 117, and the party prevailed
                            again in the 2012 polls, garnering 115 seats. Both times Modi won his contests and returned
                            as chief minister.<br>During his time as head of the Gujarat government, Modi established a
                            formidable reputation as an able administrator, and he was given credit for the rapid growth
                            of the state’s economy. In addition, his and the party’s electoral performances helped
                            advance Modi’s position as not only the most-influential leader within the party but also a
                            potential candidate for prime minister of India. In June 2013 Modi was chosen the leader of
                            the BJP’s campaign for the 2014 elections to the Lok Sabha.

                        <p>After a vigorous campaign—in which Modi portrayed himself as a pragmatic candidate who could
                            turn around India’s underperforming economy—he and the party were victorious, with the BJP
                            winning a clear majority of seats in the chamber. Modi was sworn in as prime minister on May
                            26, 2014. Soon after he took office, his government embarked on several reforms, including
                            campaigns to improve India’s transportation infrastructure and to liberalize rules on direct
                            foreign investment in the country. Modi scored two significant diplomatic achievements early
                            in his term. In mid-September he hosted a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, the first
                            time a Chinese leader had been to India in eight years. At the end of that month, having
                            been granted a U.S. visa, Modi made a highly successful visit to New York City, which
                            included a meeting with U.S. Pres. Barack Obama.
                            <br>
                            As prime minister, Modi oversaw a promotion of Hindu culture and the implementation of
                            economic reforms. The government undertook measures that would broadly appeal to Hindus,
                            such as its attempt to ban the sale of cows for slaughter. The economic reforms were
                            sweeping, introducing structural changes—and temporary disruptions—that could be felt
                            nationwide. Among the most far-reaching was the demonetization and replacement of 500- and
                            1,000-rupee banknotes with only a few hours’ notice. The purpose was to stop “black
                            money”—cash used for illicit activities—by making it difficult to exchange large sums of
                            cash. The following year the government centralized the consumption tax system by
                            introducing the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which superseded a confusing system of local
                            consumption taxes and eliminated the problem of cascading tax. GDP growth slowed from these
                            changes, though growth had already been high (8.2 percent in 2015), and the reforms
                            succeeded in expanding the government’s tax base. Still, rising costs of living and
                            increasing unemployment disappointed many as grandiose promises of economic growth remained
                            unfulfilled.<br>

                            This disappointment registered with voters during the elections in five states in late 2018.
                            The BJP lost in all five states, including the BJP strongholds of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,
                            and Chhattisgarh. The rival Indian National Congress (Congress Party) won more state
                            assembly seats than the BJP in all five elections. Many observers believed that this
                            portended bad news for Modi and the BJP in the national elections set for the spring of
                            2019, but others believed that Modi’s charisma would excite the voters. Moreover, a security
                            crisis in Jammu and Kashmir in February 2019, which escalated tensions with Pakistan to the
                            highest point in decades, boosted Modi’s image just months before the election. With the BJP
                            dominating the airwaves during the campaign—in contrast to the lacklustre campaign of Rahul
                            Gandhi and Congress—the BJP was returned to power, and Modi became India’s first prime
                            minister outside of the Congress Party to be reelected after a full term.<br>

                            In his second term Modi’s government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir,
                            stripping it of autonomy in October 2019 and bringing it under the direct control of the
                            union government. The move came under intense criticism and faced challenges in court, not
                            only for the questionable legality of depriving Jammu and Kashmir’s residents of
                            self-determination but also because the government severely restricted communications and
                            movement within the region.<br>

                            In March 2020, meanwhile, Modi took decisive action to combat the outbreak of COVID-19 in
                            India, swiftly implementing strict nationwide restrictions to mitigate the spread while the
                            country’s biotechnology firms became key players in the race to develop and deliver vaccines
                            worldwide. As part of the effort to counter the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
                            Modi undertook executive action in June to liberalize the agricultural sector, a move that
                            was codified into law in September. Many feared that the reforms would make farmers
                            vulnerable to exploitation, however, and protesters took to the streets in opposition to the
                            new laws. Beginning in November, massive protests were organized and became a regular
                            disruption, particularly in Delhi.<br>

                            Modi’s policies backfired in 2021. Protests escalated (culminating in the storming of the
                            Red Fort in January), and extraordinary restrictions and crackdowns by the government failed
                            to suppress them. Meanwhile, despite the remarkably low spread of COVID-19 in January and
                            February, by late April a rapid surge of cases caused by the new Delta variant had
                            overwhelmed the country’s health care system. Modi, who had held massive political rallies
                            ahead of state elections in March and April, was criticized for neglecting the surge. The
                            BJP ultimately lost the election in a key battleground state despite heavy campaigning. In
                            November, as protests continued and another set of state elections approached, Modi
                            announced that the government would repeal the agricultural reforms.

                            elect
                            him prime minister. Modi campaigned hard, portraying himself as a pragmatic candidate
                            capable of
                            turning around India’s economy, while his critics portrayed him as a controversial and
                            divisive
                            figure. In May 2014, he and his party were victorious, taking 282 of the 534 seats in
                            the Lok
                            Sabha. The victory marked a crushing defeat to the Indian National Congress, which had
                            controlled country politics for most of the previous 60 years, and sent a message that
                            India’s
                            citizens were behind an agenda that moved away from a secular, socialist state to a more
                            capitalist-leaning economy with Hindu nationalism at its core.On May 26, 2014 Modi was sworn
